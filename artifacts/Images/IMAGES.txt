This "Images" directory is for any 2D image that is used as: a graphic for a UI element, a symbol for some game element, or even a symbol for the game itself. Icons are placed here too and could be used as the game icon, in the UI, or elsewhere in game. These are not necessarily sprites, so they should be overlaid on the UI canvas, not rendered in the 3D scene. Please feel free to create further sub-directories if more organization is needed. This is a temporary txt file. Feel free to delete after adding artifacts here.
