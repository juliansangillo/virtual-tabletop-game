This "Sprites" directory will be for storing 2D images (.png files) that will be imported into the Unity project and rendered in the 3D scene. Unlike images overlayed onto the UI canvas, sprites are technically a part of the 3D scene, despite being 2D. Use this for any 2D element in the game, or use in place of "Models" if the whole game is 2D. Please feel free to create further sub-directories if more organization is needed. This is a temporary txt file. Feel free to delete after adding artifacts here.
